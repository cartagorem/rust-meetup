# Rusty Aquarium

---

## Montioring visualization

Visualize monitoring data as a serene aquarium

---

## Why

Static graphs are boring

Opaque for the uninitated

Looks beautiful

---

## What can it be used for?

System monitoring

Web request tracking

E-commerce metrics

---

## How it works

Periodically reads a JSON file with input data

Input data defines fish size, speed, and species

---

## Input data

The `size`, `speed`, and `bubbles` values are multipliers

```json
{
    "school": [
        { "fish": "crab", "size": 1.0, "speed": 1.0, "bubbles": 1.0 }
    ]
}
```

---

## Generating data

Programs to generate input data is not included

System monitoring application included as exemple
