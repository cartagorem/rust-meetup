## Mashing

* Malt, mainly from barley, is crushed

* Single infusion, temperature, or decoction

## Chilling 

* The boiled wort is chilled
* Aeration to help yeast reproduce
* Yeast culture added
* Yeast converts sugar to alcohol

---

## Fermentation

* Takes up to two weeks
* American IPA is dry hopped after primary fermentation
* Lager ferments at 4-12C
* Ales ferments at 18-22C
* Saison ferments at 22-32 C

---

## Bottling and carbonation
